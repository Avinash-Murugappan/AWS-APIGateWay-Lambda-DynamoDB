# AWS - API GateWay - Lambda - DynamoDB
The application architecture: Angular, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB. Angular application (compiled version) is deployed in our S3 bucket using S3â€™s static Web site hosting capability. The angular application sends and receives data to/from the backend using Lambda and API Gateway. DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function.
